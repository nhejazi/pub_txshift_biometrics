Code to reproduce the results reported in ["Efficient Nonparametric Inference
on the Effects of Stochastic Interventions under Two-phase Sampling, with
Applications to Vaccine Efficacy Trials"](https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.13375),
N.S. Hejazi, M.J. van der Laan, H.E. Janes, P.B. Gilbert, D.C. Benkeser,
_Biometrics_ (2020).

* To reproduce the simulation study reported in the manuscript, examine the
  `simulations` directory and the directions in the `README.md` file it contains.
* To reproduce the data analysis results reported in the manuscript, examine the
  `application` directory and the code it contains.

_N.B._, both directories contain scripts to install the [appropriate version of
our `txshift`
package](https://github.com/nhejazi/txshift/releases/tag/biometrics) for the
simulation studies and our empirical illustration of the methodology.

Should any concerns arise, please [file an
issue](https://github.com/nhejazi/pub_txshift_biometrics/issues/new) with a
clear description of the problem encountered.
